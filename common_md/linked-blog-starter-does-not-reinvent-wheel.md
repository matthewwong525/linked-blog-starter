I'm not a fan of [reinventing the wheel](reinventing-the-wheel.md), thus, I've searched for the best libraries out there to help me make this website. Here are a few external libraries I used:

## Converting MD to HTML

* [obsidian-export](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export) (Obsidian MD -> [Common MD](https://commonmark.org/))
* [remarkjs](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) (Common MD -> HTML)
* [github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) (HTML -> Beautiful HTML)

## Others:

* Obsidian Git to help with [publishing notes from within the Obsidian Vault](connect-obsidian-vault-with-github.md)
